It’s been 5 months since I started video game development by creating <a href="https://github.com/Lajbert/MonolithEngine">my own 2D game engine</a>. Just so happen to be that <a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare 48</a> took place last weekend, and I’ve decided to test my newly acquired skills and the engine in the event. I had 48 hours to make a video game alone, including graphics and audio, so it was quite a challenge for me (especially that I lack drawing/animation knowledge).<br>
Although I was not able to finish the game they way I wanted, I still managed to make something playable, and I’m very happy about it! It was fun, educational and very tiring, totally worth it!

You can visit <a href="https://lajbert.itch.io/">my itch.io page</a> to try the game: behold the mighty <a href="https://lajbert.itch.io/mullettime">Mullet Time</a>!

Have fun!
