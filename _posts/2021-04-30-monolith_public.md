Originally I was planning to work on it for a few more weeks at least before opening it up, but since <a href="https://lajbert.github.io/blog/ld48/">Ludum Dare 48</a> Compo event happened last weekend, where contestants had to make a game alone in 48 hours (including graphics and audio) with publicly available source code, I’ve decided to make the whole thing public sooner.
There is still a lot of work ahead of me with the engine, so keep on eye on the repository if you’re interested in the project!

You can find Monolith engine <a href="https://github.com/Lajbert/MonolithEngine">on my Github repo</a>
