Now that my studies are done (for a while at least), I’m investing my free time into creating an actual game! It’s going to be a small puzzle game using <a href="https://github.com/Lajbert/MonolithEngine">Monolith Engine</a>. This will be my first commercial release and it’s only going to utilize only a small fraction of what the engine can do in it’s current stage, but I’d like to have an actual, finished game and I think I came up with a pretty unique idea in the brain teaser game genre, and the scope is also realistic. I’ve already started working on the basics, I’ll keep posting my progress once it’s ready to be shown to the public.

Keep coding!
