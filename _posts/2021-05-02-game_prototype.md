It’s a simple platformer game demo, which demonstrates typical scenarios for a platformer game. This doesn’t utilize everything in the engine, but still gives a pretty good idea of what to use and what it can achieve in it’s current state. It’s really short, only takes like 3-5 minutes to play it through, and you can’t die just yet, after all, it’s for testing and showcase purposes, not for commercial use 🙂
If you’d like to try it, here is the Windows executable:
