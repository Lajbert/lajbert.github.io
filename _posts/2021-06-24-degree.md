I’ve been through hell of a months lately, but I’m back to business now. I’ve managed to acquire my Computer Science degree (better late than never…) which means I had also finished my bachelor’s thesis regarding 2D video game engine development using MonoGame. I will share this document publicly, hopefully some people can benefit from it.  
Please note that although I’m a seasoned software engineer, the video game development is a fairly new domain for me, and although I did my best to write this engine as good as possible, there might things I’m doing wrong or just simply not the best way possible. I will update the document as I also gain more experience, and if there is something that can be done better, don’t hesitate to let me know.  
The engine will evolve further and although I will do my best to reflect these changes in this document, the purpose of this isn’t to serve as a documentation for my engine, but to give some ideas on how to implement your own video game engine.  
I hope you’ll enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it, and let me know what you think about it!
